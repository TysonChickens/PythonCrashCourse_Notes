# Python Crash Course Chapter 5: If Statements

Programming often involves examining a set of conditions and deciding which action to take based on those conditions. Python's `if` statement allows to examine the current state of a program and respond appropriately to that state. The ability to write conditional tests allow the program to check any condition of interest.

## Conditional Tests

In every `if` statement, there is an expression that can be evaluated as `True` or `False` and it is called a *conditional test*. Python uses values of `True` and `False` to decide whether the code in an `if` statement should be executed. If a conditional statement evaluates to `True`, Python executes the code following the `if` statement. If the test evaluates to `False`, Python ignores the code following the `if` statement.
